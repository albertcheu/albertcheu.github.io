====================
Welcome to my game!

The objective is to find a pattern obeyed by the left-hand image
Select which image to view with the slider beneath

Each problem-image consists of a grid of symbols. Each row of the grid obeys the mystery pattern.

A symbol is colored shape (i.e. a green triangle).
There are three color classes (Red, Green, Blue) and six shape sets (Box, Triangle, Circle, X, Star, Face)

To the right of the problem-image is the interaction region, where you have to drag tiles into the four Rule Rows. Every solution must start at 1.

A tile can be a color class, a shape set, or a symbol. For instance "1: R B box" says that each row of the problem-image consists of a red symbol, a blue symbol, and a box of any color.

In addition, there is the OR tile. For instance, "1: G OR X" means that each row of the problem-image is made up of either one green symbol OR one X

Finally, a Rule Row can be referenced in other Rows (or itself!). For instance, "1: X 2" means an X is followed by whatever Row 2 says.

Each valid solution gets 50 points, minus one point per tile. For instance, if a solution has 8 tiles in total, the final score is 42.
