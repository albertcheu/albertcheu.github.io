I enjoyed this movie. But other people didn't.

And they didn't just dislike it; no, they seem to have an active disdain.

As I write, *Suicide Squad* sits at a sad 26% on Rotten Tomatoes. This number is derived from the fraction of positive reviews from professional critics. On the other hand, the score from the audience is 74%.

I'm not one to cry conspiracy or otherwise dismiss negative criticism out of hand, so I took a gander at the snippets from the professional reviews.

> It wants so desperately to be subversive and irreverent in the manner of Fight Club or, more likely, Deadpool. And yet the most shocking thing about it is how risk-averse it turns out to be.

It's true that the movie plays it safe. None of the main characters are truly irredeemable[^1] and the good ol' take-over-the-world plot generator is in full play. But the fact that it's a PG-13 movie made by a studio "desparately" trying to catch up with the competition should have been sign enough that the film would avoid taking chances.

> These supervillains are tiringly two-dimensional, with their back stories played out like cut scenes from a video game.

This only makes sense if you hate video games. Shorthand for backstory is fine[^2], especially if the bulk of the characters aren't meant to be more than "two-dimensional."

This is a summer action movie. Contemplations on human nature and contemporary moral dilemmas would be nice but are not necessary for a good film. Pulp has its place.

> time is pulled like taffy at the edge of a black hole, which is a fine comparison to this flick, where explosions and CGI, helicopter crashes are trapped with no hope of escape into a story that might make them worth seeing

I don't understand this. Pulled out of context?

> A vapid, soulless, tedious and painfully boring blockbuster. A contender for one of the worst films of the year.

Someone likes their adjectives.

Look, I understand if someone has a different viewpoint from me, but I simply cannot comprehend how *Suicide Squad* would be considered "worst film" when its immediate predecessor, *Batman v. Superman*, is absurdly more flawed---"souless, tedious and painfully boring blockbuster" comes to mind.

> Suicide Squad amounts to an all-out attack on the whole idea of entertainment.

...What? It's a movie. A motion picture. You might like it, you might not like it, but it can't attack entertainment when one of its goals is to entertain. The only scenario that I would find that feasible is a propaganda film in a totalitarian regime promoting censorship.

But, uh, this isn't that movie. It's just a summer action flick. Why the hyperbole?

There's been a petition to shut down Rotten Tomatoes because of these reviews. I do not support this. The site simply aggregates opinions. It's a noble goal.

I'm inclined to think that the instinct that compels one to make such a petition is the same that compels another to groupthink and hyperbole.

Free speech is a helluva drug; enjoy responsibly.

As I said, the movie is pretty by-the-books but enlivened by the performances. There's enough charm and weird delight in watching comic book characters beat up faceless armies and make quips.

Batman is Batman. No gun in sight and he goes out of his way to make peaceful arrests.

Joker and Harley are the main couple, with Flagg and Moon being the fairly bland accessory. There's a comparison to be made, what with one side being powerful and dangerous, while the other is drawn into his/her world. Of course, Flagg is "noble" enough to get a happy ending but Harley isn't; she's with her puddin' but I think we all know that isn't healty.

Deadshot is fine, he gets a young daughter to give his character pathos. But if we're being honest, his costume is more interesting than his personality.

Katana is sort of there, and so is Boomerang and Killer Croc. I'm convinced that they were added to make an actual squad, otherwise it would just be Harley, Deadshot, and El Diablo.

Speaking of, I liked him. Sure, I knew he would take one for the team just from reading the promotional materials[^3], but the reveal and sacrifice were cool regardless. And there's something to be said about simplicity.

[^1]: i.e. Harley is "bad" insofar as she is shown to be a loon rather than, say, kill anyone; all avoid harming children; etc.

[^2]: We don't need to see the Waynes killed over and over, good God.

[^3]: He wants to stay out of the fight, establishing that he's the most decent man on the team. His power level is unknown, which is the same descriptor for Enchantress. So we have a good guy as strong as the antagonist...
