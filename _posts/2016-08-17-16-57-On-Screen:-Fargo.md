There are many reasons to like FX's series but I enjoyed three aspects the most.

### Humor

Hanzee: "Redhead. Heavyset. Male."

Store Clerk: "Uh, this is a family establishment."

### Female Characters

The movie has Marge quickly catch the killer; there isn't much time for reflection or obstructionist bureacracy.

The first season has Molly quickly deduce the men at the core of the killings but she's bogged down by a superior who refuses to see the bleak picture she uncovers. Being hit by friendly fire also does not help, but she sticks to her theory, eventually proven right. In a year's time.

The second season is has even more explicit messages. Peggy feels trapped in her husband's home, resorting to hoarding travel and fashion magazines to fill the void. Her justification for the hit-and-run is a scattered quasi-feminist rant, meant to invoke a mix of disdain and pity. Flyod takes the mob-family reins from her incapacitated husband, only to have her peace talks undermined by her sexist son. Dodd also abuses his daughter, culminating in her betrayal.

### Decency Ultimately Wins

The only (wo)man who has a stable family life is the one who has a happy ending. This is a recurring theme. Even though "bad things" happen to ordinary people, the perpetrators are caught or killed.

I find this refreshing, what with the glut of anti-heroes and villain protagonists on screen. It is good, from time to time, to be reminded of what we could be.
