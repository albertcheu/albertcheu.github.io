I moved to Boston a few weeks ago. I transitioned quicker and smoother than I thought I would. I suppose living out of state last summer prepared me. Also, helping is the fact that the new neighborhood (Jamaica Plain) approximates my old neighborhood (Sheepshead Bay), in terms of public transportation, percentage-greenery, and residential quality.

Fun note: on a crowded (Orange line) train, I said "Excuse me" to get out. And people actually moved a nontrivial amount of the way! I would've gotten at most three inches of extra space in NY.

On the academic/research front, I've begun reading papers on multi-agent search on a line. There a few interesting questions/scenarios you can come up with.

I only have to be on campus three out of five weekdays. It's pretty great.
