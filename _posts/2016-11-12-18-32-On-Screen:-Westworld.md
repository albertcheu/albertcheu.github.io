(Spoilers ahead for the first 6 episodes)

From the minds that brought us *Person of Interest* comes a bewildering mashup of the Old West and the fall of the machines.

By fall, I mean the Biblical fall. There are obvious analogues: Ford as God, Arnold as the serpent, Dolores as Eve. The Delos nudity policy parallels the nudity in the Garden: *people* wear clothes, not constructs lacking self-awareness.

The proverbial fruit of knowledge seems to lie at the heart of the Maze. Metaphorical or not, Dolores, the Man in Black, and Ford are swirling headlong towards it. Dolores, for her own self-actualization; MIB for "something true"; Ford, to quash the greatest challenge to godhood.

A god who controls and one who frees featured in *Person of Interest*, but this time they are human. As far as we know.

Bernard seems a likely candidate to be a robot-who-doesn't-know-it. The scenes with Dolores could be set decades ago, with Jeffrey Wright playing Arnold. Bernard's lack of reaction to the fact that Ford's dad was in the photo suggests he's wired to misperceive.

And it seems like some viewers are wired to fixate on the dual timeframe hypothesis. It is possible that Nolan and co. are playing a lon con with us but [here's evidence to the contrary](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5ano1q/episodes_15_spoilers_a_single_timeframe_argument/).

Finally, I'd be remiss if I did not praise the score. Ramin Djawadi is a musical genius. From the opening credits to the instrumental covers of popular music, the sound just draws me in. I look forward to more Nolan-Djawadi projects...
