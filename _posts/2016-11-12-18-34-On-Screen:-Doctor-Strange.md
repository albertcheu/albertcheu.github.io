(Spoilers ahead)

This is a good movie. The only real complaint I have is that portions feel rushed; upon reaching the Dormammu confrontation, I was surprised we were at the end.

People have been talking about the visual effects, but I was struck by the visual motifs that tied to the narrative: hands and time.

* Strange tells the surgeon to cover his *watch* (with his *hand*)

* Due to metal poisoning from the bullet, the patient is running out of *time*

* Strange damages his *hands* when he is *speeding* in his cool car

* The rescue crews *took a long while* to find him

* The recurring lesson the Ancient One wants to impart on Strange is to *let go* of his ego

* She herself *hands over* responsibility to Strange upon death, but not before *stretching out her last moments* to see the snow fall.

* Strange prevents calamity by controlling *time* with his *hands*

* Strange continually dies in a *time loop*, revealing that he can in fact *let go* of his "fear of failure" as the Ancient One called it.

* Strange puts his broken *watch* ("Time will tell how much I love you") back on *his still-shaking wrist*. He could fix both broken things. And he could attempt to get back with Christine, he could go back to the way things were before. But he accepts that the time has passed. A new hour is at hand.

As an endnote, it's refreshing how non-violent the soon-to-be Sorcerer Supreme was portrayed. A doctor, he is ashamed that he killed someone. He basically brings civilians back to life. And in the grand finale, he doesn't attempt a fistfight with the villains; wits win.
