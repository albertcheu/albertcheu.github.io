Whoa. Everything was revealed.

Ford is apparently the hero of the piece, and the Man in Black (or William, as an excellent match cut underscored) is merely a self-serving gamer.

I'm decidedly mixed about Dolores killing the board+guests. On one hand, it is very clear that she has been through a lot at the hands of the guests. On the other, did the board know about the nascent sentience of the hosts? If they did, then Dolores' revenge is justified: they kept a slave race knowingly. If they did not, then Dolores killed ignorant but arguably innocent civilians.

In any event, this is "a birth of a new people" from the death of the old. The ethics seem kind of reversed from Nolan's *Person of Interest*, considering that other show was predicated on the virtue of all intelligent life, human included.

No on-screen resolution on Elsie and Stubbs. ARG content reveals the former's status (alive), presumably implying that she was the one who lured the latter.

Maeve's kickass "escape" with Hector and Armistice is everything you could ask for. Except maybe it could have done with more "narrative-god-mode": wouldn't it have been even cooler had she commanded the (some of) guards to stand down or kill one another?

She chose family over escape, while Dolores chose blood over entrapment; this seems to set up quite the foil/conflict next season. Perhaps like the Machine and Samaritan?
