Philosophy

|  | Person of Interest | Westworld |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Humanity has peaked | Root: Amazing. We've managed to perfect the apple...And yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings. The human race has stalled out. | Ford: we've managed to slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?...we're done. That this is as good as we're going to get. |
| Humanity sucks | Root: One day, I realized all the dumb, selfish things people do... it's not our fault. No one designed us. We're just an accident, Harold. We're just bad code. | Ford: We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy...Never place your trust in us. We're only human. Inevitably, we will disappoint you.|
| We never truly die | "if you helped someone, or loved someone, if even a single person remembers you, then maybe you never really die." | "An old friend once told me something that gave me great comfort. Something he read. He said Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin never died. They simply became music." |
