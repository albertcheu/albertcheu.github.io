|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Two men work on AI... | Harold & Nathan | Arnold & Robert |
| One is known to the public... | Nathan | Robert |
| While the other has been erased. | Harold | Arnold |
| One died trying to do good with their creation... | Nathan | Arnold |
| While the other secretly picked up the task for years | Harold | Robert |
| The construct(s) have their memories wiped periodically... | Every night at midnight... | Like a deep and distant dream.
| Though they have a way of remembering. | Ernest Thornhill and the paper printouts | The reveries
| "Is this now? Or is this one of my memories?" | Spoken by The Machine... | ...and Bernard |
| Literature provides a way of teaching AI | Flashing blue error messages are excerpts from works on self-preservation | Dolores: "Change is a common theme"
| A person in dark clothing sees in AI a source of meaning and purpose... | Root: The universe is infinite and chaotic and cold. And there has never been a plan. At least not till now. | William: Something true. |
| So they set out to set the construct(s) free | I just want to set it free. | What if I told you I'm here to set you free? |
| Humanity has peaked | Root: Amazing. We've managed to perfect the apple...And yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings. The human race has stalled out. | Ford: we've managed to slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?...we're done. That this is as good as we're going to get. |
| Humanity sucks | Root: One day, I realized all the dumb, selfish things people do... it's not our fault. No one designed us. We're just an accident, Harold. We're just bad code. | Ford: We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy...Never place your trust in us. We're only human. Inevitably, we will disappoint you.
| An old British man (who had a dog as a child) appears to desire control of AI for his own benefit | Greer: It is human nature to want to control the means to wealth | Ford: The hosts are the ones who are free. Free here under my control. |
| But he is devoted to their cause. | [Samaritan] runs on logic... | You needed time. Time to understand your enemy. To become stronger than them. |
| One AI begins a bloody rise to power to the music of "Exit Music (for a Film)" | Samaritan | Dolores |
| Another AI chooses family over freedom | The Machine | Maeve |
| We never truly die | "if you helped someone, or loved someone, if even a single person remembers you, then maybe you never really die." | "An old friend once told me something that gave me great comfort. Something he read. He said Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin never died. They simply became music."
