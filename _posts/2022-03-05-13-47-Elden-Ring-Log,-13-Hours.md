I thought I'd keep track of my progress in this massive open-world video game. I've played around 13 hours over 3 sessions. In addition to the event log copied below, I am also keeping track of facts picked up from conversations and item descriptions (e.g. people/factions, history, locations, and objects in the world). I won't post them until I'm done with the game.

Session 1:

* Playing as a Nightfolk sorcereress. Eager to find lore about this race.

* At night, I fought a few of Godrick's soldiers. I panned the camera around and saw a dark figure behind them. Then it started moving towards me and it became clear it was a giant black knight. I screamed and fled on horseback.

* Fanged Imps were useful in defeating the beastman boss living in a cave

* Hopped over to Weeping Peninsula. There's seeming nothing of interest near the minor Erdtree, save for the Erdtree Avatar. Did not engage.

* Upon climbing Tower of Return, I warped to Leyndell Royal Capital! The map got way bigger and I got the healing talisman

* Found the apostate mage living in a cellar. Was she trapped by the Pumpkin-Head, or was it her guard dog?

At some point, I got the summoning bell and the wolves along with it.

Session 2:

* Defeated a Red phantom near the round building north of Limgrave

* Found two evergaols and the bear in Earthbore cave. Did not beat any bosses, including Erdtree avatar.

* Found Mourne Castle, guarded by a big robot. Same type of robot as in Leyndell castle.

* Inside Mourne Castle, discovered beastmen worshipping (?) something burning. Did not get close enough for fear of being mobbed.

* Found Leonine Misbegotten. Blue Jellies near the arena, Red Jellies outside the castle grounds

* Noticed many dead soldiers wearing Godrick's armor.

* Outside Castle Mourne, a sword gave the following text (paraphrased) "Siege of Castle Mourne: A lone hero fights for vengeance, only to fall at the hands of Lord Godfrey."

* There's a poison area near the castle with many stakes and hollows

* Found Oridya's Rise and the Memory stone within. There's a painting of a damaged cliffside tower flanked by two trees.

* Obtained East Limgrave map.

* Desceded Siofra River Well. Appearance and item descriptions indicate the underground city is the Eternal City. Humanoid ihabitants wield starlight staves, consistent with a starlight shard item description

* Ghost Glovewort bolsters "renowned ashes," whatever those are.

* Found Hallowhorn, but let it sleep. Encountered spectral minotaurs: they protect obelisks that I can ignite.

* Picked up an Elden Ring Arc from a dead scholar in a cave.

* Summonwater Village is crawling with skeletons and a Mariner. Gave up after realizing my weapons did nothing against it. D, who hunts those who live in death, warned me to avoid the area.

* Found Kenneth Haight, who informed me of a fort south of Mistwood in need of an exterminator

* An old woman near a ruined bridge in the north of Limgrave told me to head to the foundation of gold, traverse Raya Lucaria, and reunite "half crescents"

Session 3:

* Went to Haight's fort. Ghost spoke of "demi-human's mother" who was taken and "knight bedeviled by blood." Defeated that knight and acquired Blood Slash. Also acquired Dectus Medallion (left) which is consistent with the old woman's words.

* A sword says "Godfrey [, unvanquished,] finds grace lost, tattered, and faded."

* Dectus Medallion says to go east. On the way, I defeated Anastasia the Tarnished Eater and then found a site of grace. There, Melina invited me to the Roundtable Hold.

* Many paintings inside RTH. Spoke with D again. Diallos is looking for Lanya. Smith Master Hewg is a prisoner who wants to forget some woman. Fia offers hugs but the wording about her presence and what the hugs do is suspicious.

* Found an imp lock in RTH which I later opened. A bit of a waste since all I got was a crossbow I did not have the strength to use.

* Back in East Limgrave, an old woman spoke of a festival in the South, flowers to the East, and "heart of scarlet rot." Cryptic.

* Reached Dragonbarrow and the Tower of Caelid. Fell down a few times. At the bottom was the Godskin Apostle. Died almost immediately.

* I learned how to use the Blood Slash skill. Seeing that it was useful against the tought guards in the Tower of Caelid, I decided to try it against Leonine Misbegotten. Thankfully the skill was also powerful against it. Defeated the boss after several tries.

At some point, I found Margit. Tried fighting him a few times but did not get far.
