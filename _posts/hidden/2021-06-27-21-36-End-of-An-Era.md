I'm going to head to Georgetown for my post-doc. I can't believe it has been five years already.

When I started my PhD career, I did not know how much I would have to learn. But thanks to Jon, my co-authors, and my peers at Northeastern, I've found a place in the academic community.

I also did not anticipate how much media I would consume in the interim. I suppose being free of children did allow me the time to play an inordinate amount of videogames. Not to mention the television series. Who would have thought I would start and finish all seven seasons of *The Clone Wars* in my last year?

Whatever the next years hold, I am sure I will be quite the ride. A plague-free ride, hopefully.
