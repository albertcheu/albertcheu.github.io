PS5 without subscription (so no multiplayer, unfortunately). I've been keeping a pen-and-paper log of my journey and lore discoveries. I reached the Flame of Ruin (at around the 118 hour mark), so I thought I'd share the highs and lows so far.

Character & Playstyle:

* Nightfolk. Looks a bit like Sellen.

* Sorcery build throughout (Astrologer origin). Int, Vigor, Mind, and Dex got almost all the points, in that order.

* Preferred Spells: Great Glintstone Shard, Ambush Shard (for shield-bearing enemies), Glintstone Stars / Stars of Ruin (for agile enemies)

* Found the Meteorite Staff just under 20 hours in. Kept it as my main weapon until I leveled up enough to use Lusat's against the Fire Giant

* Swords, roughly in order: Warhawk Talon, Rogier's Rapier, Lazuli Glintstone Sword, Serpent-God's Sword, Moonveil

* Still using Carian Knight's shield. It looks beautiful.

* Occasionally use Gurranq's Clawmark seal for Cure Poison, Assassin's approach, Law of Regression (very helpful for Lake of Rot)

Journey Highlights:

* Discovered Sellen & Leyndell in first play session. My jaw dropped from the scale of the dragon

* Got terrified by a black knight (night's cavalry) and ran like hell. I took one of them down...60 hours later.

* Found Siofra River Well in third play session. This actually messed me up later on because I mistook this for Nokron proper: I thought Ranni's quest was supposed to lead me here, so I did not bother looking for the giant hole in the ground until I broke down and googled

* Reached Caelid in my fourth session, to search for the 2nd half of the Dectus Medallion. I stumbled across the Godskin Apostle in the Tower's basement and it stomped me.

* Apparently missed Alexander in Limgrave and found him in Gael Tunnel

* I got D killed. Oops.

* Took me about 30 hours until I finally defeated Godrick. I managed to win by the skin of my teeth.

* I think there was a bug with Rogier: there was the option to ask him about the body under stormveil, but I did not realize there was a body under stormveil. So basically I triggered his (and Ranni's) quest on accident

* Speaking of Ranni, I was a bit miffed that she wasn't where Rogier said she would be. Had to kill Radhan to get her to show up. Never noticed Patches at the battle, since I was too busy not dying

* Leyndell (and the soundtrack) is beautiful *chef's kiss*

* My greatest gaming moment was realizing I could turn invisible to safely reach the Frenzy-Flame Tower. Thank you, Sellian sorcery.

* I heard a girl crying in a ruin. It seemed like she was sealed behind a magic door, so I thought I'd free her... by killing the nearby jellyfish. Oops. At least this was reversible. I've kept the talisman, both for its effects and as a reminder not to kill randoms

* Renna and Ranni sound so similar, it took me a while before I understood that Iji was telling me where Ranni went and not where Ranni was.

* I killed the Dung-Eater. But now it seems like he was a mentally-ill outcast? Oops.

* Did not hand over Seluvis' potion to anyone, since it was clearly poison. Did not do Volcano Manor (murder re)quest.

* I love Rykard's voice. Did not love the boss fight. We were just supposed to spam the special sword's skill, right? Because that's what I did.

* I despise Crystalians, especially the three that have scarlet rot

* I am mad about Sellen. I wanted to see some weird magical discovery, not a grotesque ball.

* I got Fia killed. Oops. At least I slew that dragon on my first try.

The handful of things I googled / saw on Twitter before reaching Fire Giant:

* how to break glowing statues

* how to find Ranni (kill Radhan) and how to get into Nokron (enter hole)

* the location of the hidden cave (Sellia Hideaway) hinted at in a note. There are like four "precipices" visible from the Sellian graveyard, which one?!

* fanart of Millicent w/ Malenia's arm, which tipped me off this was an option

After reaching (close to) the endgame, I've become very liberal with Google for quests. Though the only part of Nepheli's quest I had to google was how to trigger the end (rest at Godrick's site of grace)

Theories (no spoilers, please)

* Millicent is Malenia. She has amnesia, a missing arm, and is searching for Malenia.

* Vyke's grape and the Shabriri grapes are for a Frenzy-Flame ending.

* There's a recurring theme of gender ambiguity. St. Trina is of uncertain gender, "Radogan is Marika", and Three Sisters includes Seluvis, who I think is referred to as "he/him"? Unless I got some names confused, again.

* Marika/Radogan shape-shifted using whatever magic Rennala uses for "rebirth." Maybe combined with a Mimic Tear, since they were made to "forge a Lord" and Radogan was an Elden Lord (in which case, they really took "go fuck yourself" literally).
