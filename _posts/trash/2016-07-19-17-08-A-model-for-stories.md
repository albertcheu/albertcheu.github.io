Having spent too much time playing videogames and watching TV, I've come to observe a pattern in how stories work. I made[^1] a diagram today.

As I note in the top-left, this is neither all-encompassing nor original. But I think it does serve as a useful analytical tool.

Case in point: take any episode of a murder-mystery show, like *Perry Mason* [^2]

1. Introduce the episode's key characters

2. Someone dies and an innocent is blamed for the crime

3. Mason is hired

4. Mason begins to discover multiple suspects

5. At the prelim hearing, Burger and Mason deflate one another's theories in quick succession. With so many different names being thrown around, viewers are sometimes liable to forget who was killed to begin with.

6. Mason & Paul Drake discover a key piece of evidence.

7. Mason suspensefully lures out the true killer who ultimately makes a dramatic confession. The defendant either returns to their normal life or is in an even better station.

Open-world videogames (i.e. *inFamous: Second Son*, *Batman: Arkham City/Knight*, and *Dragon Age: Inquisition*) feature the wheel as well. Complexity comes in the form of side-quests and RPG powerset-building/resource management. After the player gets bored, frankly, of the diversions, they return to the main plot which changes the gameplay. Hopefully, the story is written well and the difficulty is balanced so that the player can't help but accelerate toward the conclusion.

Games, along with movies, can have the final "peace" portion be false. The sequel hook foreshadows future conflict as a consequence of the protagonist's actions --- the story momentum carries over. Watch *Stranger Things* (Netflix) and you will observe a well-executed and creepy one.

My own writing is like this, but it's only in retrospect that I can observe the pattern.
