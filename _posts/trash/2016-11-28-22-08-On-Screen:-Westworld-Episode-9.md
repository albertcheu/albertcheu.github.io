Oh boy. So many theories confirmed or given much credence.

The two-timeline interpretation must be true because

1. Dolores is gutted by Logan, flees. But then she is unharmed. She must be remembering the last time she was there. (William tries to find her but she probably ends up floating in the river)
2. The picture is found by Old Abernathy. It is tattered, as if years had done damage to it. If William = MIB, he probably dropped it after his wife Juliet died.

Here's what I think the general sequence of events is:

**~35 years ago**: Blue dress Dolores is taught by Arnold. Later kills him+town for reasons unknown

**~30 years ago**: Dolores is in blue dress when she meets William. Later gets pants. Gutted by Logan, flees, dies in the river somehow, reset by the park. Ford probably removes whatever enabled her to have memories/free will.

**Past three decades**: William loses faith that he can see “his” Dolores again, but returns to Westworld repeatedly as the Man in Black. Discovers Maeve’s life-likeness...

**Present**: MIB drops the photo of Juliet while fighting Teddy at the Abernathy ranch. He does something to blue-dress Dolores in the barn to recreate what he did to Maeve. Doesn’t quite work, until...

Ford includes reveries: Dolores is triggered by “Violent delights” phrase. Breaks her loop after having a flashback to MIB. Gets pants, experiences flashbacks: sees herself from previous eras (Pariah party, dead in the water). Runs to church, remembers she killed Arnold. Found by MIB

Other remarks:

* Bernard is Arnold is dead. So horrifically sad. But Maeve and co. are about to find his body...

* Speaking of bodies, we haven't seen Elsie's. She might be alive and lured Stubbs (the less-famous Hemsworth) to the Ghost Nation trap.

* Maeve and Hector, sitting in a tent. K-i-s-s-i-oh man they're on fire!

* Old Abernathy not only has memories of being a cannibal professor (*cough* hannibal *cough*) but, thanks to Charlotte, has 30+ years of data. And is about to be smuggled out...

Whatever's going to happen, it's going to be *good*.
