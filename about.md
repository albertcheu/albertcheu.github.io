This site is made possible by Github Pages and Jekyll.

I have also made use of:

* [example code from Matthew James Taylor](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/bottom-footer-demo.htm) to set a proper footer

* [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com) as an invaluable CSS attribute reference

* [Adrn's response on this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961589/positioning-background-image-adding-padding) to make background images fill padded space

* [This StackOverflow post on centering background images](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643305/centering-a-background-image-using-css)

* Many other posts on StackOverflow I lost track of.

* [This codepen example](https://codepen.io/gnclmorais/pen/cHkqt) for the post navigator.

* Python documentation, to help me write a neat script to generate new posts

[^1]:Well, most of the way. Remainder filled by genre TV, action movies, and story-rich games.

[^2]:The school has went through literally half a dozen name changes, most recently "Polytechnic Institute of NYU" and "NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering".
