I have also made use of:

* [example code from Matthew James Taylor](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/bottom-footer-demo.htm) to set a proper footer

* [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com) as an invaluable CSS attribute reference

* [This StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643305/centering-a-background-image-using-css) and many others

* [Adrn's response on this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961589/positioning-background-image-adding-padding) to make background images fill padded space

* Python documentation for a neat script to generate new posts

[^1]:Well, most of the way. Remainder filled by genre TV, action movies, story-rich games, and a customized philosophy that is a Frankensteinian blend of Mill, Hofstadter, Quine, and more (but not More)

[^2]:The school has went through literally half a dozen name changes, most recently "Polytechnic Institute of NYU" and "NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering".
