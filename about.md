Theoretical Computer Science all[^1] the way; soon-to-be PhD. student at Northeastern University.

[^1]:Well, most of the way. Remainder filled by genre TV, action movies, story-rich games, and a customized philosophy that is a Frankensteinian blend of Mill, Hofstadter, Quine, and more (but not Moore)

Alumni of New York University, Tandon[^2] School of Engineering, 2016.

[^2]:The school has went through literally half a dozen name changes, most recently "Polytechnic Institute of NYU" and "NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering".

Alumni of Stuyvesant High School, 2012.
