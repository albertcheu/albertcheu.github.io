In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we pulled ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

You can download the (Windows) game [here](http://gamejolt.com/games/circum/153034).

I took that course because I love games (maybe a little too much).

Here are my brief thoughts/criticism of some AAA games:

* Dragon Age Inquisition: Too much crafting (whenever I can craft, I do it. So I take forever). But spectacular story and voice acting.

* Arkham Knight: Too much tank. Why can't we all get along? But Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are still great.

* Fallout 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along?

* Uncharted 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along? Awesome rope physics, gorgeous scenery, and cutting-edge motion capture, though.

* inFamous Second Son: Side missions were a tad repetitive. Great flow of powers.

* Deus Ex: Mankind Divided: Missed some storytelling opportunities. Great stealth and visuals, though.

I researched van der Waerden games in 2015.
