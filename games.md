In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we pulled ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

I took that course because I love games (maybe a little too much).

Here are my brief thoughts/criticism of AAA games I have played:

* Dragon Age Inquisition: Too much crafting (whenever I can craft, I do it. So I take forever). But spectacular story and voice acting.

* Arkham Knight: Too much tank. Why can't we all get along? But Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are still great.

* Fallout 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along?

* Uncharted 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along? Awesome rope physics, gorgeous scenery, and cutting-edge motion capture, though.

* inFamous Second Son: Side missions were a tad repetitive. Great flow of powers.

* Mirror's Edge Catalyst: Story was kind of vague but the flow of movement more than made up for it.

* Deus Ex: Mankind Divided: Missed some storytelling opportunities. Great stealth and visuals, though.

* Rise of the Tomb Raider: "Death gives life meaning" is a line at the end that had no thematic buildup. Still, the stealth, combat, and aesthetic is phenomenal.

* Dishonored 2: The only quibble I have with this game is that maps are hard to get to in the menu. Everything else is great.

I researched van der Waerden games in 2015.
