In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we put ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

Final release TBD.

I took that course because I love games (maybe a little too much).

Here are my brief thoughts/criticism of some AAA games:

* Dragon Age Inquisition: Too much crafting (whenever I can craft, I do it. So I take forever)

* Arkham Knight: Too much tank. Why can't we all get along?

* Fallout 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along?

* Uncharted 4: Too much pew-pew-pew. Why can't we all get along?

I researched van der Waerden games in 2015 (see "Research").
