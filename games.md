In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we pulled ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

I took that course because I love games (maybe a little too much).

Here are my brief thoughts/criticism of games I have recently played:

* *Ni No Kuni* has a horrendous combat interface. It would be solid experience if there were a tactical pause or if it were purely turned based. Otherwise, the music and animation is S-tier.

* *Ghost of Tsushima* is super fun and I wept twice at two incredibly executed death scenes. I think this game hits harder if you're Asian, though that might just be me projecting.

* *The Last of Us Part II* is a lot. Literally and figuratively. See my "Types of Play" for a sliver of my thoughts

* *Mages of Mystralia* has a cute artstyle that's a bit in conflict with the rather dark narrative. The composability of spells is pretty cool. There are rough edges to the story, but not enough to stop me from recommending it.

* *Control* has a very unique world that you can't help but become drawn into. The powers you obtain are crazy, though I will say that there were many times I failed to grab/redirect an incoming missile...
