In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we pulled ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

You can download the (Windows) game [here](http://gamejolt.com/games/circum/153034).

On a related note, here are my brief thoughts/criticism of games I have recently played:

* *Demon's Souls* is great, but I can't get Boldwin's voice out of my head now: "I can forge weapons for you, for a fair price."

* *Hitman 3* is the quintessential slapstick puzzle comedy game.

* *Bloodborne* is wild fun, but I must say I enjoyed exploring the world far more than fighting bosses (the Shadows of Yharnam are a real pain in the ass)

* *Tell Me Why* has, in Alyson Ronan, an all-time-great protagonist. I can't say I loved her brother Tyler as much.

* *Assassin's Creed Valhalla* has orlog, which is a surprisingly fun dice minigame. And they actually managed to make the modern-day storyline engaging.

* *Ni No Kuni* has a horrendous combat interface. It would be solid experience if there were a tactical pause or if it were purely turned based. Otherwise, the music and animation is S-tier.

* *Ghost of Tsushima* is super fun and I wept twice at two incredibly executed death scenes. I think this game hits harder if you're Asian, though that might just be me projecting.

* *The Last of Us Part II* is a lot. Literally and figuratively. See my "Types of Play" for a sliver of my thoughts
