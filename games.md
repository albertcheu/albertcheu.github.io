In Spring 2016, I took Andy Nealen's Game Design course. I worked on a team to make Circum, a one-button atmospheric game. Andy ripped our game apart for straying from the One True Minimalist Path, but we pulled ourselves together and the results are nothing less than spectacular.

I took that course because I love games (maybe a little too much).

Here are my brief thoughts/criticism of games I have recently played:

* *Mages of Mystralia* has a cute artstyle that's a bit in conflict with the rather dark narrative. The composability of spells is pretty cool. There are rough edges to the story, but not enough to stop me from recommending it.

* *Control* has a very unique world that you can't help but become drawn into. The powers you obtain are crazy, though I will say that there were many times I failed to grab/redirect an incoming missile...

* *GreedFall* is another one of the long line of open world RPGs that are big-but-empty. And oh boy, all the walking... Still, there's interesting stories to be explored here.
