I am a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University working on [differential privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/pedagogical-document-dp_0.pdf). Very roughly speaking, it is a constraint imposed on the design of algorithms that ensures a form of plausible deniability for people contributing data. My particular focus is on DP in settings where there is no single authority trusted to preserve privacy.
