I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University in the College of Computer and Information Science. My advisor is Jon Ullman.

I currently work on differential privacy. Here, we'd like to evaluate functions on personal data. Reporting the exact value reveals information about the contributors; roughly speaking the game is to add enough randomness to create "plausible deniability" about any individual's data, while keeping the answer close to the true value.

Here are my ccepted papers:

1. [Skyline Identification in Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04213), presented at the [Internation Symposium on Informtation Theory 2018](https://www.isit2018.org/)

2. [Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01394), presented at [Eurocrypt 2019](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2019/)

3. Manipulation Attacks agaisnt Local Differential Privacy, to be presented at [Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy 2019](https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/)
