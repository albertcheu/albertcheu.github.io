I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University. They took a picture of me for my profile on their website, so I could link to that in the future.

My advisors are Jon Ullman and Ravi Sundaram. Pretty chill guys.

I am currently in the problem-hunting phase of grad school: primarily reading papers and pondering variants of their problems. The core model I'm looking at is searching for "treasure" on an infinite line (in one or two directions) using multiple agents.
