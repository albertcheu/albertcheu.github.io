I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University. They took a picture of me for my profile on their website, so I could link to that in the future.

My advisors are Jon Ullman and Ravi Sundaram. Pretty chill guys.

I designed an algorithm that can be seen as an experimental procedure to determine which drugs are cost-effective, where drugs have unknown effectiveness rate. To use the name of our paper, "Skyline Identification in Multi-Armed Bandits."

I will also work on differential privacy, a means of giving noisy answers to questions about datasets such that we trade accuracy for plausible deniability about a person's participation.
