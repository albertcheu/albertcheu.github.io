I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University in the College of Computer and Information Science. My advisor is Jonathan Ullman.

I currently work on differential privacy. Roughly speaking, we add randomness to aggregate statistics (like how many people in a dataset have some illness) in order to create "plausible deniability" about any individual's data, while keeping the statistics reasonably accurate.

Here are my papers on this subject:

1. [Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01394), presented at [Eurocrypt 2019](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2019/).

2. [Manipulation Attacks agaisnt Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09630), presented at [Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy 2019](https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/).

3. [Separating Local & Shuffled Differential Privacy via Histograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06879), presented at [Information Theoretic Cryptography 2020](https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html).

4. [Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481).
