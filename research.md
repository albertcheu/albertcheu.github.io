I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University. They took a picture of me for my profile on their website, so I could link to that in the future.

My advisors are Jon Ullman and Ravi Sundaram. Pretty chill guys.

I designed an algorithm that can be seen as an experimental procedure to determine which drugs are cost-effective, where drugs have unknown effectiveness rate. The broader field in which the problem resides is called the "multi-armed bandit setting."
