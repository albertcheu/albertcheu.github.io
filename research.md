I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University in the College of Computer and Information Science. My advisor is Jon Ullman.

My first accepted paper was [Skyline Identification in Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04213).

This paper was accepted to the [Internation Symposium on Informtation Theory (ISIT) 2018](https://www.isit2018.org/).

The statement from advisor:

I currently work on differential privacy. Here, we'd like to evaluate functions on personal data. Reporting the exact value reveals information about the contributors; the game is to add enough randomness to create "plausible deniability" about any individual's data, while keeping the answer close to the true value. Prof. Ullman and I were co-authors on a paper accepted in TPDP 18.
