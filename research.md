I am a PhD. student at Northeastern University. They took a picture of me for my profile on their website, so I could link to that in the future.

My advisors are Jon Ullman and Ravi Sundaram. Pretty chill guys.

I am currently in the problem-hunting phase of grad school: primarily reading papers and pondering variants of their problems. The core model I'm looking at is searching for "treasure" in a discrete space with noise; in more technical terms, best arm identification in the multi-arm bandit setting with bounded or unbounded number of arms.
