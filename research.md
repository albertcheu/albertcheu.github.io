I work on differential privacy. Roughly speaking, we add randomness to aggregate statistics (like how many people in a dataset have some illness) in order to ensure any individual has plausible deniability regarding their data, while keeping the statistics reasonably accurate.

Here are some of my recent papers on this subject:

1. [Differentially Private Histograms in the Shuffle Model from Fake Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02739), to be presented at S&P 2022. Joint work with Maxim Zhilyaev.

2. [Shuffle Private Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09805). Joint work with Binghui Peng, Matthew Joseph, and Jieming Mao.

3. [The Limits of Pan Privacy and Shuffle Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08000). Presented at [STOC 2021](http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2021/). Joint work with Jonathan Ullman.

4. [Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481). Presented at [Symposium on Discrete Algorithms 2021](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda21). Joint work with Victor Balcer, Matthew Joseph, and Jieming Mao.

5. [Manipulation Attacks in Local Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09630). Presented at [S&P 2021](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/). Joint work with Adam Smith and Jonathan Ullman.
